What's next?
------------

### Actions

- "application level" events
- doing the same things in multiple places
- doing more than one thing when performing an action
- index of what the app can do, don't have to scan the views

### Dispatcher

- decouple stores from views/actions
- they subscribe to action names, and decide if they care about it or
  not
- data dependencies

### Flux?

- highly greppable codebase
- interesting, but will slow you down and make react feel confusing,
  don't worry about until later ... if you want.
