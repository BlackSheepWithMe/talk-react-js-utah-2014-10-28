Building an Application In, and Then Around, React Components
=============================================================

This was all live coded (by Ryan Florence at the 10/28 reactjs meetup), the iterations are found in the git commit history [here](https://github.com/rpflorence/talk-react-js-utah-2014-10-28/commits/master).

To run the app:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Well, I mean, I live coded until it broke, and then I did a quick
`git checkout` of a commit that worked ~without anybody noticiing~.
